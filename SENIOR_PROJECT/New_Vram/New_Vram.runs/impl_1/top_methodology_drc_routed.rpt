2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, clk_wiz/clk_in1, pat_wr_en_p1_reg/C

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.597 ns between pat_wr_en_p1_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and RectFill/rect_state_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
